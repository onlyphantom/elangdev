Elang is an acronym that combines the phrases **Education (E)** and **Language Understanding (Lang)**. It is an education-centric toolkit to demonstrate the ideas behind many Natural Language Processing strategies commercially used today.

## Elang
Elang also means "eagle" in Bahasa Indonesia, and the _elang Jawa_ (Javan hawk-eagle) is the national bird of Indonesia, more commonly referred to as Garuda. 

The package provides a collection of utility functions and tools that interface with `gensim` and `scikit-learn`, as well as curated negative lists for Bahasa Indonesia (kata kasar / vulgar words, _stopwords_ etc) and useful preprocesisng functions.

# Quick Demo

Install `elang`:
```bash
pip install elang
```

Performing word embeddings in **4 lines of code** gets you a visualization:
```py
from elang.plot.utils import plot2d
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

model = Word2Vec.load("path.to.model")
plot2d(model)
```
Output:

It even looks like a soaring eagle with its outstretched wings!

## Scikit-Learn Compatability
Because the dimensionality reduction procedure is handled by the underlying `sklearn` code, you can use any of the valid [parameters](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) in the function call and they will be handed off to the underlying method. Common examples are the `perplexity`, `n_iter` and `random_state` parameters:

```py
model = Word2Vec.load("path.to.model")
bca = model.wv.most_similar("bca", topn=14)
similar_bca = [w[0] for w in bca]
plot2d(
    model,
    method="TSNE",
    targets=similar_bca,
    perplexity=20,
    early_exaggeration=50,
    n_iter=2000,
    random_state=0,
)
```
